          <h3>History and Evolution of AI</h3>
          <p id="para-3" class="paraas">
            The concept of AI dates back to ancient times, with myths and stories depicting artificial beings endowed with human-like intelligence. However, the formal discipline of AI emerged in the mid-20th century, with the groundbreaking work of pioneers like Alan Turing, who proposed the Turing Test as a measure of machine intelligence, and John McCarthy, who coined the term "artificial intelligence" and organized the Dartmouth Conference, which is considered the birth of AI as a field. Over the decades, AI has witnessed significant advancements, from early symbolic AI systems and rule-based expert systems to the rise of machine learning and neural networks in the late 20th century. The advent of big data, cloud computing, and advanced algorithms has fueled the rapid progress of AI, leading to breakthroughs in areas such as natural language processing, computer vision, autonomous systems, and reinforcement learning
